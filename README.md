# 🌐 Blockchain-Based Attendance Verification System

## Project Description

The **Blockchain-Based Attendance Verification System** aims to use blockchain technology to manage and verify attendance in a secure and transparent manner. This system leverages smart contracts to ensure that attendance records are accurately tracked and verified, providing a reliable and tamper-proof method for recording participant presence in various events, workshops, and educational sessions.

## Key Features

- **📜 Decentralized Attendance Tracking**: Uses blockchain to record and verify attendance in a decentralized and immutable ledger.
- **🤖 Smart Contract Management**: Automates the attendance verification process through smart contracts, ensuring accuracy and reducing administrative workload.
- **⏱️ Real-Time Attendance Logging**: Provides immediate logging of attendance as participants check in, ensuring real-time updates and access.
- **🔒 Tamper-Proof Records**: Ensures that attendance records cannot be altered or tampered with, guaranteeing the integrity of the data.
- **🛠️ Administrator Controls**: Allows administrators to manage student registrations and set attendance limits, providing flexibility in managing different events or sessions.
